# KnetMiner

KnetMiner is a web application to search and visualise genome-scale knowledge networks. It is 
used by scientists in academia and industry to accelerate gene-trait discovery research. 
KnetMiner offers features such as keyword, gene list and genome region search, query 
refinement, gene ranking, gene set enrichment analysis and interactive visualisation of 
knowledge networks and genomic information.  

The web app [can be deployed on site or in the AWS cloud using Docker][10]. Examples of free 
and public KnetMiners are available at https://knetminer.org.  

KnetMiner also offers a set of high-level web API endpoints to access and visualise the 
knowledge networks from other applications (see details on our [wiki][20]).

The data that power the web application are also available as [FAIR data][30], through
[linked data and knowledge graph endpoints][40].
