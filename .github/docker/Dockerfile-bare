# TODO: Python is for AWS and that would be worth a separated image
# TODO: is python-dev needed?
# 
# TODO: the 'n' commands below downgrade Node.js, due to a lib clash problem
# (https://github.com/Rothamsted/knetminer/issues/432). This should be removed when
# that's fixed (in Travis too).
# 
# The /bin/sh link is rebuilt because its default points to dash (come on!) and we have
# scripts assuming bash instead.
