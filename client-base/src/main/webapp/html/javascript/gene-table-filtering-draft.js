/* 

Note: you might want a different behaviour: every filter application reset everything to the
original table and always applies to it.
  
If that's the case, change outlined manager this way:
  
1) turn #filters into a dictionary of id => filter. Use the constructor for doing this:

filter = [ new KnetScoreFilter( myid ), GraphDistanceFilter( myid ), ... ]
this.#filters = filters.map ( f => { f.getId(): f } )   

2) Introduce #currentFilterId

3) toggleFilterUI() updates 2)

4) isRowSelected uses #filters [Â #currentFilterId ] only and starts from the original table.

5) applyFilters() doesn't do this.setGeneTable ( filterTable () ), but it still triggers the
   gene table re-rendering.
