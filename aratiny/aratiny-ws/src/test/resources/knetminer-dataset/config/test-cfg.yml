# Beware that some of ${} placeholders are interpolated (ie, resolved) by Maven, others are
# resolved by the Knetminer configuration component.
#
# Note to Knetminer developers: as explained elsewhere, Maven interpolates AT BUILD TIME, you can't 
# rely on it at runtime, where it isn't used at all (anymore, eventually).
#

# For the tests, we have to use this OXL, which overrides the defaults loaded above
